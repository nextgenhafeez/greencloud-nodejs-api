Network Topology & Security for Node.js API on Google Cloud Run
This document outlines the network topology and security considerations for the greencloud-nodejs-api-service deployed on Google Cloud Run. Due to Cloud Run's serverless and fully managed nature, direct management of traditional network components like VPCs, subnets, Security Groups (AWS equivalent), or Network Access Control Lists (NACLs) is abstracted away by Google Cloud.

1. Network Topology
Your Cloud Run service operates within Google's highly scalable and resilient network infrastructure, which is managed entirely by Google.

Managed Network: You do not provision or manage specific Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs), subnets, or routing tables for the Cloud Run service itself. Google handles the underlying network setup.

Public HTTPS Endpoint: Your API is exposed via a unique, publicly accessible HTTPS URL (e.g., https://greencloud-nodejs-api-service-wup63a4a5a-uc.a.run.app). Google automatically provides:

Load Balancing: Distributes incoming requests across your service instances.

SSL/TLS Termination: Handles HTTPS encryption/decryption, ensuring secure communication with clients.

Global Network Edge: Leverages Google's global network for low-latency access.

Internal Communication (Egress):

Internet Egress: By default, your Cloud Run service can make outbound connections to the internet (e.g., to connect to MongoDB Atlas).

VPC Access Connector (Not currently used): For communication with private resources within a GCP VPC (like Cloud SQL private IP instances), a Serverless VPC Access Connector would be used. This is not configured for your current setup as MongoDB Atlas is external.

2. Security
Security for your Cloud Run service is handled through a combination of Google's managed platform security and explicit IAM policies.

Ingress Security (Who can access your service):

IAM-based Access Control: Access to your Cloud Run service is primarily controlled by Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles.

Public Access (allUsers:roles/run.invoker): Your service is configured to allow allUsers (anyone on the internet) to invoke it by granting the roles/run.invoker role to allUsers on the service. This makes your API publicly accessible.

No Traditional Inbound Firewall Rules: You do not configure traditional inbound firewall rules or Security Groups on the individual container instances. Cloud Run's managed environment inherently protects instances from unauthorized direct network access.

Egress Security (What your service can access):

MongoDB Atlas Connection: Your application connects to MongoDB Atlas over the public internet. The connection is secured by:

TLS/SSL: All data in transit is encrypted.

Authentication: Username (nextgenhafeez) and password (securely retrieved from Google Secret Manager).

MongoDB Atlas IP Access List (Recommended External Control): For enhanced security, it is highly recommended to configure the IP Access List in your MongoDB Atlas cluster to only allow connections from specific IP addresses. For Cloud Run, these would be Google's dynamic outbound IP ranges, or a static IP if a Serverless VPC Access Connector with Cloud NAT is used.

Google Secret Manager Access:

The Cloud Run service account ([PROJECT_NUMBER]-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com) is granted the roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor IAM role. This allows your running container to securely retrieve the MONGO_PASSWORD (and potentially JWT_SECRET if migrated to Secret Manager) at runtime.

Container and Platform Security:

Managed Runtime: Google automatically manages the underlying operating system and runtime environment of your containers, including applying security patches and updates.

Container Isolation: Each instance of your container runs in an isolated environment, preventing interference between different services or tenants.

Least Privilege Principle: The service account used by your Cloud Run service is configured with only the necessary permissions (run.invoker for public access, secretmanager.secretAccessor for secrets).
